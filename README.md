## Machine Learning - Coursera

This is my first attempt at using 'git' with 'GitHub'. This is also my first 'Markdown' file, here's to the firsts.

This repository includes my attempts at the programming exercises for the Coursera **Machine Learning** course by **Andrew NG**.
I have also included the lecture slides used for the lectures.

I'll also try to attach a ML cheat-sheet, possibly one that is specific to the course.
